    "\n",
    "I Data Ingestion: \n",
    "\n",
    "•The process begins with ingesting raw data from different sources, such as databases, files, or APIs.\n",

    "•Business knowledge can come in handy at this step of the pipeline.\n",
    "•\n",
    "\n",
    "IV Model Training: \n",
    "•The preprocessed data is fed into the chosen ML algorithm to train the model.\n",
    "•The training process involves adjusting the model’s parameters to minimize a predefined loss function, which measures the difference between the model’s predictions and the actual values.\n",
    "•\n",
    "\n",
    "V Model Validation:\n",
    "•To evaluate the model’s performance, a validation dataset (a portion of the data that the model never saw) is used.\n",
    "•Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score can be employed to assess how well the model generalizes to new (unseen data) in classification problems.\n",

    "VI Hyper parameter Tuning:\n",
    "•Hyper parameters are the parameters of the ML algorithm that are not learned during the training process but are set before training begins.\n",

    "•Collaboration\n",
    "•Using pipelines, data scientists can collaborate over each phase of the ML design process and can also work on different pipeline steps simultaneously.\n",

    "\n",
    "•Reusability\n",
    "•We can create pipeline templates for particular scenarios and can reuse them as per requirement.\n",
    "•For example, creating a template for retraining and batch scoring.\n",
    "•\n",
    "\n",
    "•Heterogeneous Compute\n",
    "•We can use multiple pipelines which are reliably coordinated over heterogeneous computer resources as well as different storage locations.\n",
